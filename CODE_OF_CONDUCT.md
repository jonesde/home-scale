Stand Your Ground

The requirement: reduce fear and distrust
The design: stand your ground

Standing your ground is passive confrontation. The alternatives are all reactions to fear:

- fight is active confrontation
- flight is active avoidance
- freeze/hide is passive avoidance

Any strategy that is a reaction to fear also provokes fear in others, constrained only by their level of trust. No other strategy in response to a conflict between people will calm fear in others because every other combination of confrontation vs avoidance and active vs passive may result in increased fear and distrust in others.

Fear is the mind killer because in a state of fear one's entire focus is on the things feared. One is blind to the fear itself. Every other consideration about anything social or physical is lost to the focus on what is feared. One outward behavior of fear is distrust. Active distrust escalated by the cycle of fear during interactions between people where both choose fear-based strategies is the problem covered thoroughly in "Talking to Strangers" by Malcolm Gladwell.

Stand your ground is the only universally applicable social stance to reduce fear, tension, and distrust.

It is speaking instead of acting. It is then listening instead of talking.

It is the only stance that incorporates love: the benefit of the doubt and deferral of judgment.

It is the only stance that incorporates awareness: an ability to gather information needed for judgment if and when it is needed in the future.

For those who fear and those who are feared: stand your ground.

When in doubt: stand your ground.
When in danger: stand your ground.
When in fear: stand your ground.

To heal the fear and distrust in our communities and societies: simply approach every conflict by standing your ground with passive confrontation and let the power of love and awareness heal the rift.
