### The Opportunity

These three constructive trends enable one exponential virtuous cycle. This virtuous cycle is not just virtuous in that it is self-sustaining and self-improving once it gets started, it is also beneficial to humanity. To the extent that the 3 elements of the virtuous cycle are able to operate, it keeps humans included in the self-replicating loops of the future of technology. It also increases distribution of technology, leveling the economic playing field and democratizing individual influence in society.

It might sound old-fashioned or even communist, but this isn't about property, it is about information and access to technology. For a more stable and productive world, technology belongs in the hands of all people. Information about technological realities is spreading faster around the world with the internet and other modern means of communication. As people become more aware of disparity in access to technology we are rightfully crying fowl play. Be it medical or production technology, or any other variety, people know their lives could be better if they had access to it. When they find out why they can’t have access to it, it seems inhumane. Perhaps it is.

This virtuous cycle is internally motivated by what is effectively profit, or more specifically to transform material into something more valuable for one's self or for others to use. If one individual can operate an automated machine to generate an income sufficient to earn a living, another can as well. Compared with most tools used in the past for production of any good, interacting with a computer with an interface designed for the task is far easier and dramatically lowers the bar for productive involvement.

Some skill in maintaining the machine, or sufficient business acumen to afford to pay others to do so, will still be needed. Working 40-80 hours a week to provide for material needs of a family will not. 5-10 hours per week for configuration, maintenance, sales, accounting, etc sounds much more amenable to enjoying modern opportunities. Eventually with automation there is no reason for production not to be very close to zero hours per week, leaving all time to invest in designing product and running the business, as much or little as you prefer for your desired lifestyle and goals.

Once it gets going, this virtuous cycle will expand small-scale manufacturing until it fills the planet with a plant in every neighborhood. Online and local stores for physical goods will partly be a thing of the past. Why would you bother shopping for a static physical good that is difficult to modify and slow to ship when you could shop for a design that you can modify to your heart's content and have a machine build in minutes or hours? If you happen to like a popular design it's even better, others may be making it semi-bulk not too far away and selling it for a lower cost than you could manage yourself for a single unit.

The heart's content being our compass for innovation, this increased ability for the heart to follow will create new markets of goods and services that will cause a massive disruption to current ways of getting things, and doing things.

As a bonus this technology includes the potential to re-use many types of materials in existing goods to create new goods, or to repair or upgrade existing goods. When something breaks you just pick up all the pieces left over and drop them in the machine (or ask a robot to do it for you). Early on the level of automation isn't as important as the economic and environmental viability. Those are the priorities for initial designs.

### The Dilemma

This addresses so many public and private concerns that no attempt to block it will succeed for long. It also introduces new risks and concerns that will rightly be used to limit adoption. If anyone in any neighborhood in the world can manufacture arbitrarily shaped metal parts, there is no way to stop democratization of metal-based technologies. 

That includes firearms, and even if gunpowder is banned completely innovation in compressed air and other propellants is advancing. Even if not firearms, with access to more technology more people will have access to tools that can be used for harm. Whether this is a good thing depends on whether you believe the majority of people have beneficial or neutral intent toward others.

I believe that there are far more people in the world who want peaceful, productive, and joyful interactions with other people than who want to control, destroy, or distress. Democratizing technology in that case will reduce overall potential for harm.

As a historic reference, this was the principle behind the 2nd Amendment of the United States Constitution. The concept of a militia is in contrast to a large professional army, all citizens encouraged to ready themselves for hostile invasion. Distributed technology strengthens a nation under the defense-oriented militia model. A nation which embraces this model will be able to defend against much larger invaders, especially with the force multiplying potential of automated technology.

As one example of why, consider the fragility of supply chains. Due to supply chain disruptions in recent years many more people are familiar with the concept. If production is centralized it is easily destroyed and war efforts are impacted dramatically. If production is distributed, in millions of small production facilities around the country, it wouldn’t even be possible to cut off a community from weapons, ammunition, armor, defensive structures, survival equipment, and many other types of supplies.

This also completely changes the nature of readiness time windows and defensive preparations. With distributed production and material already distributed because it is used for making other things (or can be recycled from other things), only enough defensive machinery for the first few days of a war is needed. More can be produced on a moment’s notice anywhere in the nation. There is also more flexibility for preparation based on intelligence, even less certain intelligence, because the price is changing production priorities on some existing infrastructure and using some existing materials. Those materials can be reclaimed if not lost, reducing the cost to machine time and energy.

Current 3D printing may be slow, but high precision metal parts from powdered metals can already be produced by a machine costing less than a car. The parts produced have unique mechanical properties to handle things like air pressure very well. It is also possible to work with exotic powdered metals that are difficult to work with in other forms.

A smaller SLS (laser sintering) 3D metal printer is available for around under $100k. A legal, papered fully automatic Colt M16A2 army rifle now costs around $50k (and the cheapest low quality automatic weapons start around $15k). If you’re in the market for more than one quality rifle, a 3D metal printer is already the better choice. The price multiplying effect of restrictions in economics is significant, but irrelevant when the technology production itself is democratized.

This is not just coming, it is here. Any of our neighbors could be doing this right now, building both weapons and machines to build weapons. Various corporations and governments are already public about using this technology for weapon production.

The potential and issues around tools of harm may turn out to be minor compared to the economic opportunities and current system and institution disruption that will come from this technology. For most people our day to day lives are dominated by other material and social concerns, and the impact of technological availability has far more potential there. It is a tool of creation, including the ability to create tools for anything our minds can come up with, or anything any other human mind has come up with and shared.

The cost of production on current 3D printers isn’t zero and never will be, but it will be decreasing faster than current methods over time due to its flexibility and wide adoption of common methods. Early on the important part is not that it is cheaper per part, but that it is close enough to be competitive when considering other factors such as convenience, flexibility, and local availability (less shipping, no import/export complications).

The important part is to enable home-scale manufacturing competitive with current mass production technology.

### Automated Home-Scale Manufacturing

The enabling characteristic of automated additive manufacturing is that it functions at a small scale but provides capabilities that were previously only available at a large scale, and with a large enough volume to offset tooling and configuration costs. It turns out sintering metal powder scales both up and down really well, and that's just one of many current and potential future approaches used for automated manufacturing. To enable the virtuous cycle current machines aren't adequate, some progress is needed. That may be more a matter of design and IP constraints than of a need for new technology or science.

The main thing is they need to speed up, a lot. Right now they are used mostly for low scale operations, either high value production parts or tinker/lab/prototype parts. What is needed is production parts at volume, getting serious about machines that are affordable like a car is affordable or a business is affordable and not like a hobby is affordable. For the added cost, it also needs to be much more capable than the rough-edged tinker toys but much faster than current production high value part machines.

Eventually it will get there, but we can speed it up with wide scale adoption and collaborative innovation. For wide scale adoption and to democratize the benefits of the technology it needs to be all open source, or public domain, with no licensing or other restrictions on use of or modification to the designs. It needs publicly available schematics, instructions, and source code for software to run the machines. It also needs forums and shared source repositories for people to communicate and share, but thanks to the world of open source software there are freely and easily available resources for those.

To help make the machine viable and proven for production, companies that make the machines have an opportunity to use them and participate with their customers in a global community to refine them. The opportunity to collaborate in this way is unique to automated home-scale manufacturing because of the wide audience with an incentive to improve their production of whatever it is they are building.

From my experience with open source software, it is also likely that most people who use the machine will modify it or improve it. When that is available for something that people use to earn a living, they will use it. When it comes to earning a living more efficiently, people will try every lever and knob they can get their hands on, and with open hardware and software they can get their hands on nearly all of the levers and knobs.

Semiconductors are a current exception, but with RISC-V and small scale silicon fabs, that could change too. The biggest barrier there is intellectual property constraints, even for the low wavelength light source used for nearly all modern microprocessors. That is a global monopoly by one company. That is how closely guarded current state-of-the-art microprocessor technology is.

Intellectual Property and Access to Technology

Throughout history humans have attempted to monopolize and limit access to new technology, especially technology that can be applied to control and coerce other humans. Solving the problem of dangerous technology by attempting to limit access to it has led to the greatest catastrophes in human history. No natural force can hold a candle to the force of humans using technology to attempt to prevent other humans from having access to a technology or to the resources necessary to enable it.

Technology is increasingly allowing small scale efforts to produce results that historically required large institutions. As manufacturing technology reaches the inflection point where the majority of goods can be produced for less cost and with greater flexibility in small home-scale fabrication plants, the potential for centralization of power also diminishes. The world is roiling now from democratized access to information, and it may roil even more from democratized access to things.

People are also starting to realize the potential for technology, especially for automation. With advances in AI and automated manufacturing we all see our jobs at risk, and indeed they are. As technology improves and is increasingly more capable than people, the value of an individual to a corporation or government diminishes. 

The two edged sword is clear. The one is the increasingly centralized power of corporations and governments, an increase in their influence over our daily lives. With that comes higher prices and fewer options. The other side of the blade, swinging back and forth cyclically, is lower wages due to decreased demand for what humans are able to do. This is the inevitable course of improved technology, the technology is able to do more and more tasks that humans value, and do so better and cheaper than we humans can with our minds and bodies.

One possible solution is to democratize access to technology. Democratizing access to information is a key part of that effort, but as physical beings information is only one small part of our reality. Starting with books and accelerating with computers and the internet, access to a great deal of information is democratized. Because of the value to individuals and humanity as a whole, and the viability of current technology, democratized access to the means of production for every sort of good is inevitable.

Once means of production of a wide variety of goods is widely distributed and accessible geographically and financially to any individual, the limiting factors shift to the inputs to production: material and energy.

### Material and Energy Constraints

Material is something we can figure out. In spite of public efforts, humans do very little recycling. An important part of a powder metallurgy based approach to 3D printing is that the material is a very simple powder, and easy to extract from a wide variety of shapes using atomization to powderize. Separation of components made of different materials in existing goods is still a huge problem for recycling material, but that is likely to decrease as materials are standardized instead of finished goods (driven by the flexibility of manufacture with fewer materials, fewer sources, shorter supply chains, etc).

If fab plants are locally available where a person could powderize unwanted goods, like in a neighbor's garage, then we will have more incentive to break down the goods that we no longer want in order to transform them into goods we do want. That includes broken goods we don't want into functional goods we do. If done well, that changes the material equation from how much does a person consume over time to how much does a person need, if recycled as needed, to live well. That dramatically reduces consumption and reduces the need for an economy (for better or worse).

The remaining factor to topple for the freedom of humanity is energy. With energy we can make dirty water clean and we can turn dirt into homes and computers. Without energy it doesn't matter how fancy our machines are. The good news is that even current additive manufacturing is far more energy efficient than processes it replaces, and theoretically that can be improved a lot. A progressively improved machine could also optimize for energy use, effort going into that versus other objectives as needed over time based on the cost and availability of energy.

No matter how much energy use is reduced, we “cannae change the laws of physics” and we still need energy to run any sort of machine. On a massive scale, like millions of individuals trying to built private robot armies, we might run into material constraints with what exists on earth. Given how creative we can be with materials, it may be that by the time that is a real problem we'll be mining off-planet.

The expansion of the human population could also speed up limitations on material resources, even if individuals don't try to go crazy with self-replicating automated production. Again, by the time that is a concern technology could easily progress to off-planet habitation ability. On the other hand, as a species we could mess this up and take care of the population growth concern in other ways. My vote is we democratize technology and get off this rock.

Unless we figure out something for energy the concerns about finite material won't even matter. Compared to the amount of this or that type of useful matter around us, electrical and other energy is a far greater limiting factor with current technology, infrastructure, and politics. It may be that by democratizing the means of production we solve this one too.

For example, if small scale efficient production of solar panels were possible then they could be locally produced from hopefully inexpensive resources. More importantly we might figure out some way to recycle them by processing back to a powder or some form that can be used as an input to produce new ones. If that can't be done with current solar technology, perhaps a photovoltaic material that can be recycled this way will come along. For all I know it already exists, and even if less efficient that crystalline panels can be locally re-manufactured by the same machine that uses the energy it converts, then we have an infinitely tenable solution for energy production. 

The only material it would rely on is the initial material input. Many things will still require a bit of additional material over time for maintenance and wear, but even for high wear parts like car brakes this is insignificant compared to a new part. If a recyclable solar panel technology that can be scaled down does exist already, then it is just a matter of combining it with decentralized automated manufacturing to solve the problem of energy.

While not as reliable as sun in some places, wind is the better natural resource in others. In windy places, or in places with hydro or geothermal sources, there are mechanical devices with dynamos, turbines, etc that can potentially be 3D printed. Right now parts of them can be, but things like turbines or blades are much easier to print than things like dynamos to convert the rotation into electricity. Solar panels may be easier, to print at least.

For energy the main point is that we get it by converting energy from other sources using things. If we have local means to produce things that convert energy for us, then we have local means to provide energy conversion in some form or other.

### Standard of Living and Population Growth

And that's it. If it all works out, the nature of humanity changes. A high standard of living will be achievable with little environmental impact beyond the initial material and space allocation for each person. Each of us really doesn't need that much, and it's a very big world. As technology improves, each of us can immediately benefit by locally re-manufacturing the goods we rely on. Over time technology improvements will likely allow us to reduce our material footprint if we choose, or to improve our standard of living efficiently with that material.

One might think that food is also a limiting factor to the growth of humanity. Since we're fantasizing about future technology that really exists now, we can indulge in a nod to recycling and human waste (all 3 primary states of matter represented). Hopefully we'll never have to produce technology sufficient for a human to live in a closed loop with only the material in a small space and access to sunlight. If we ever needed to, I bet even with current technology we could get pretty close.

Even without full closed-loop biosystems, the benefits of distributed food production are similar to the benefits of distribution of other goods. Robots will help with this more over time, from planting to harvesting of more difficult to care for and harvest like fruit and nuts.

Before fancier robots we can design and build semi-automated growing systems. Many have done this already, and sharing that and making it available with local production would make it accessible to most people. Being able to print specially shaped growing pots for different types of garden plants alone would make gardening far more efficient for many people.

What will "first world problems" be like when a person might seriously step into their front yard and casually wonder if they might prefer to have that rock there, or another robot servant of some sort. Perhaps there are rumors of war... maybe I'll turn that shovel into a pistol like I was thinking about. Perhaps there are rumors of peace... maybe I'll go ahead and turn that tank back into the three family cars.

### Intellectual Property and a Choice

The greatest threat to the democratization of technology is intellectual property law, especially patent law. These were originally intended to grant a temporary monopoly to inventors as a reward for sharing their invention. It has turned into nothing of the sort. It is an anti-competitive legal cudgel that limits much of high technology to only the largest companies in the world. The right persist so long that technology is always obsolete by the time patent protections are rescinded. This is no longer a reward for innovation, it is a tool for corporate monopoly and limiting access to technology.

There are many patents related to automated manufacturing, and that could become an issue. Going the open route means foregoing patent protection, but it may be necessary to file defensive patents dedicated to the public domain, buy patents, or settle lawsuits. Or, run a flock of lean companies along with hopefully many customers and in the case of a lawsuit shutdown the company and start another. The designs are all public and accessible to each of us individually, let the assets be liquidated for legal expenses and settlements. 

That's extreme, guerrilla war style business, no bueno if it comes to that. In the face of legal resistance no matter what any of us choose individually, as this emerges others may choose to survive in the way the works best for them, any way they need to do it. Countless people around the world do this now.

The choice we have as a nation, and as a world, is this: do we democratize technology and choose for ourselves what to do with technologically granted freedom from material concerns, or do we centralize control of technology and let other people decide what we will do with our time? For my part, I'd rather not spend my time in the technological utopia working in a bank or bureaucracy.

I'd rather focus on research and development of new technology while watching my robot minions make it all real. Whether it is for gardening or cooking, furniture or appliances, production or transportation, we all have interest in many things that allow us to do things or make it so we don’t have to. Whatever a person chooses to do with their time, with material or other goals, they will have more time and tools available to do so. 

Speaking of family, why is it that family size is shrinking, that people are having fewer children? Is it because somehow improved economics correlates with fewer children, or because we have less choice over how we allocate our time and resources? If my guess is correct about that, democratized technology will lead to larger family sizes.

What else will we do with our time but explore and improve the universe, and make more little people to join us in that quest? Or, if the little ones so choose, they can live in total isolation for life and only rarely have to lift a finger to provide for physical needs. Technology has the potential to make any size of groups of humans viable, scaling down to far smaller sizes with a modern standard of living than is currently possible.

Not all intellectual property law and policy is harmful, and if people choose to not participate in open collaboration there is nothing harmful in that. There is no lasting benefit to a mandate to open and share all ideas or even just functional technologies. Lasting benefit comes from voluntary open collaboration.

What is problematic now is law and policy that prevents independent design and development of technology. This is only partly a copyright issue, it is mostly a patent issue. Too many patents are too broad, and the innovation incentive of patents only applies to the large organizations that can afford to file them and defend them in court.

This is different from, but adjacent to, issues around the right to repair. This is a call for freedom to design, develop, and share. If that freedom is sufficiently granted, eventually consumers will have open choices making right to repair concerns irrelevant. Without that, there is no chance people will have full access to even the physical technology they have purchased, from cell phones to tractors. This is an increasing trend with worrisome ends in terms of price and options, and eventually the stability of society.

The hubris of patent policy needs a little attention. Only the most short-sighted makers of things think their contribution to be of more significance to any effort than the contributions of the millions of people for thousands of years who also contributed to it. To think otherwise and to lay a financial monopoly claim for such ideas and all they are built on is too much credit to the monopoly holder and too much harm to everyone else for what it represents.

Ideas do not come from people, they come from circumstances that create necessity and the tools and ideas available to a person in a moment. If we’re lucky, our minds pick up on the possibility within a few months or years after all of the necessary pieces are available, when the right frame of thought connects the dots.

The idea that this moment of connecting the dots is somehow deserving of a monopoly on the idea and every idea it is based on is too much. There are reasons that many people come up with similar new ideas at the same time. All who independently come up with the same idea simply have similar need and have access to similar tools and ideas.

The key is in access to tools and ideas, waiting for a moment of need to recur sufficiently for a mind to connect the tools and ideas needed to address it. The mind is not as important as the context, and the more we can expand the context for more people the more good ideas will emerge.

We do ourselves a great disservice as a species by so commonly withholding such ideas from others. As individuals making the choice to hold private or establish a monopoly we miss out on opportunities for collaboration with others, and that collaboration teaches us things and provides the context necessary for new ideas.

We do ourselves an even greater disservice by preventing others from sharing designs and developments freely, who see the personal and global benefits of doing so.

### The Current State of the Art

None of these ideas are new. We have been talking about a potential Star Trek Replicator like panacea from automated additive manufacturing for decades. We have also been talking about the environmental impact of high waste economics from centralized manufacturing for decades. How much longer until the one progresses enough to satisfy the other? Maybe we're already there technologically, but few are doing it yet in this way.

Current additive manufacturing technology includes methods for materials including metals, polymers/plastics, carbon fiber, graphene, ceramics, and even wood (with a binder). The products that can be produced are limited primarily by the size of the area the machine can reach, the materials it can work with, and economic factors like materials, energy, and time. If you imagine what can be made from parts that fit into a 1 meter cube, it includes a wide variety of furniture, tools, appliances, toys, and so on.

Some things like microprocessors and printed circuit boards are not possible for current general purpose additive printers, but these are made by machines and those machines will eventually be scaled down too. In general parts that require multiple materials are troublesome for 3D printers, but there are already multi-material printers and there is potential to do much better with current technology. This would enable cheap manufacture of designs that would be absurd for other methods like embedded conductors, resistors, and insulators to go along with embedded voids like shaped vents for air flow or heat dissipation. 

For economically viable production, metal is more interesting than the others. There are many high value applications for all of these materials, with some plastic handling printers capable of higher temperature polymers and even for more standard machines there are high-strength lower temperature polymers.

Once this gets going, my guess is that cheaper materials will become less relevant. If we can manufacture and re-manufacture almost as easily with better materials, and especially if the materials are easy to powderize like metal, then we might as well just use the good materials. We won't need so much of cheaper materials because we never throw anything away. We just re-manufacture it if it breaks or we want a different shape, style, color, etc.

Some current metal printers are effective for creating parts from hard metal powders which are more difficult to conventionally manufacture, items like drill bits and other cutting heads. Once worn out the remaining material in these heads can be used with additional material to create new heads. Consumable parts are one example and there are many metal products where flexible local manufacturing and recycling adds value and reduces the cost of building and operating other machines. Some higher value products, like knives made from more exotic metals, also require post processing like sharpening unless that is left as an exercise for the customer in exchange for a lower price.

Many items also have multiple parts and require manual assembly, making such products a poor fit without automated assembly. Some current products can be redesigned for 3D printing using fewer parts and taking advantage of the ability to print small engineered structural elements.

In many ways automated assembly is more difficult to do generically than part printing, but that may change as AI gets good enough to help with the scripting or direct bot control to avoid manually scripting and tuning of control scripts for each product. For products produced in higher volume, on their own or with similarly assembled products, this is less of a problem because adequate arms can be selected and specialized scripts developed to handle them. For more general assembly support, AI may be necessary.

There are ways to avoid assembly operations like only selling part kits. If the discount is sufficient, especially for high-ticket functional items, many people are willing to put in a little low-skill elbow grease to save some money. That can somewhat increase the reach of small manufacturers using automated additive machines, but without automated assembly some products will just not be a good fit. Making third party parts for some such products might be a viable business, feeding into current supply chains where assembly and other concerns are already handled. The margin isn't as good selling parts wholesale, but with 2-3 long-term supply contracts it becomes a very easy business to run. 

Industrial scale mostly automated production of medium to high value metal parts in a home-scale machine is already here. The Desktop Metal P-50 is pretty impressive, showing what can be done. It can print 10 cubic feet of bonded metal powder in 24 hours with 1200 dpi precision for sintered metal parts. It is also very expensive at around $500k.

An open machine with similar abilities can likely be made for far less but how much less, to start and over time, is a big question. My experience is with open source software. There the cost multiplier is enormous, even if you consider the labor required for initial configurations. It also has no material components putting a floor on the price like a 3D printer does.

The sintered metal approach using a binder also creates a unique opportunity for manufacturers of machines: require your own binding solution for a permanent recurring revenue stream. This is effectively a small fee for each cubic centimeter produced. Many also recommend their own metal/etc powders, but that is far more difficult to limit access to than a proprietary binder formula.

### An Open Alternative

Just musing here, but I wonder how long will that last before people realize the potential and do whatever it takes to make it happen with whatever resources they have? The principles of operation are simple enough, there is quite a bit of information about general technology and commercially available 3D printers . HP even has some nice videos on the topic with animations and such. 

Being able to produce an income, or an additional income on the side, for a car sized investment and a few hours a week is a strong motivator. That's not even the main target market. There are tens of thousands of small businesses in the USA and around the world looking for alternatives to foreign manufacturing. There seem to be more reasons for doing that all the time. Owning your own fab instead of hiring out the work, and doing it for lower cost and with lower delay, is also motivating. There are testimonials from customers of commercial machines that are already showing this.

The potential target market gets bigger the lower the price and the more types of products the technology can competitively produce. Things have been improving fairly quickly with these machines, and with increasing adoption (commercial and open) that will accelerate.

Here's the general idea for powder metal 3D printers: Use ink-jet technology to apply a binder to a layer of metal powder, and repeat to build up parts one layer at a time. The powder with no binder (or with a lubricant for sharper edges) gets removed, but is left in place to stabilize the parts until the part is stronger. The parts are heated or chemically treated to remove the binder and then heated to a high enough temperature to sinter, binding the powder together as a single piece of metal.

Sintering is a process where even exotic metals can be formed into precise shapes and then heated to a temperature lower than liquified melting to retain shape but high enough to weld each particle of powder together to make a single whole.

The principle is super simple, and chances are with a bit of creativity and quick failure iteration one could come up with alternatives that print certain types of items far faster. This isn't the only commercial approach either, there are also laser sintering approaches that work as they go instead of in an oven after printing with a binder.

There are many other alternatives to this binder jetting approach, and some scale down to slower production but less complexity/expense to around the $100k level mentioned earlier. Some other methods include fused deposition modeling (FDM), laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), and direct energy deposition (DED). One of those or something else may turn out to be better than binder printing on a powder bed, especially as technology improves for depositing higher viscosity and temperature fluids with smaller nozzles and valves (higher dpi) in larger arrays (higher concurrent print volume).

There are obviously nuances to applying the general ideas to make production ready systems, like uneven part shrinkage of 15-20% with some sintering processes. That requires correction in models to get the desired result, and similar adjustments to control for all sorts of conditions at various stages are required with different processes. Beyond the basic complexities are huge opportunities to improve the ability of the technology due to what could potentially be done by physical limitations of materials.

One example of this is the promising technology of cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM). This is the idea of spraying powder at such a high velocity that when it strikes a surface the energy of the impact fuses the material as the particles are deformed. This was originally used commercially around 20 years for coating parts. The obvious problem is the print resolution as the spray stream and splatter zone sizes tend to be large.

I’m guessing the state of the art for this is about 0.4mm (63.5dpi vs 1200-1600dpi with binder jetting) and with a deposit rate 1.2kg/day (vs up to 2,000 depending on print density) of what is being done with binder jetting, but on a 3 times more expensive machine for the two I’m comparing. Those are the specs of one recent commercial machine that is supposed to use some sort of fancy method that does not require a binder, and it flows metal powder using water. It fits the bill for CSAM, and shows the current limitations of the technology (at least commercially available technology).

If you’re looking for an example of how present need/interest and circumstances can connect things, I saw the machine that I think is a CSAM machine on an episode of Linus Tech Tips just a few hours ago, and then got into studying the various methods and processes out there. The description of the machine’s operation and the basics of CSAM match pretty well.

The potential for something like CSAM, if the resolution could be improved 20x, is not just eliminating the need for a binder but also possibly highly parallel jetting and other approaches to increase throughput. The whole point of the method is to move material really fast and use that energy for a temporary binding (to be solidified in a sinter over).

One approach that improves effective resolution and surface uniformity that is both more possible and more necessary with CSAM vs other methods, is to continuously scan the surface and iteratively deposit material where it is needed to build it up to the desired level. This means it can also be used to add to existing parts or complete interrupted jobs smoothly. That makes the control systems much more complex, but also leads to much better results and is something that can be both tuned and improved over time in software (enabling rapid iteration).

Perhaps the best future answer will be a variation on CSAM, like pre-heated “not so cold” spraying so the velocity required to get the energy required for temporary binding is not so high. With options for sintering or binding energy from pre-heat, laser light, electron beams, powder movement speed, and whatever else we can come up with, combinations can be tuned for whatever effect we need for material requirements and output objectives. Chances are the commercial machine that seems to be based on CSAM uses one or more of these energy sources in addition to velocity.

It should also be possible to balance between weak and strong sintering at the point of print to eliminate the need for post processing in a sinter oven for some materials and parts. With temperature management for the chamber and for printed surfaces, these sorts of things could potentially deposit powdered material very quickly and energy efficiently.

For print resolution (dpi) one limitation of powder based approaches is the size of the powder particles. This is can be improved by pre-processing to reduce particle sizes as needed, or by getting temperatures to the point of easy deformation through constricted jets for the pressure in use in order to handle somewhat larger particle sizes.

I don’t know how we’ll 3D print high-resolution capable print heads on a printer with the same resolution. It may be necessary to use something like micro-forms for voids to print around and then dissolve. That would be one way to get very precise shapes with spray deposition.

I also don’t know how we’ll handle arrays of tiny valves and pumps or accelerators of some sort. I guess one option is a large array of micro-pumps that can switch on/off quickly. For magnetic powders small linear motors could be used. That is a fun thought. In college I put way too much time researching how to build linear motors while taking a physics course about electricity and magnetism. I’ve always wanted to build a railgun, even cooler to build an array of hundreds or thousands of tiny little magnetic linear accelerators that build things instead of destroy things. With a two material capable 3D printing head it would be possible to print electromagnet coils in a single pass and produce things like this easily.

On a side note, some forms of rail-based linear motors might be very useful as an alternative to rotary motors and belts, with much more precise motion control as long as you have precise current control. This isn’t my idea, when looking up information related to this I found someone talking about using rail-based linear motors in a 3D printer in 2016. One huge benefit of that is they are way easier to print than coil-based rotary motors, but also not generally as efficient without any possibility for leverage by gear ratio as with rotary motors.

There is still a question of how small linear accelerators can be made by the machines themselves, but probably quite small and with the right conductor geometry a linear accelerator can be very small. They are also very hot, relying on high current to produce a magnetic field. Heating the powder as it is accelerated may be difficult to avoid, but may be a desired use of that resistive heat. The powder is heated and accelerated by the same energy. Win-win, and within certain ranges the speed vs heat imparted to the powder particle can be independently adjusted (more current through fewer coils vs less current through more, external heat venting vs capture, etc).

Whatever the technology for deposition, the methods and processes, additive manufacturing involves moving around heads to deposit material. The main job of the robots is to move around print heads with various combinations of speed and precision, in coordination with the operation of the head. Variations to scale machines up and down in size and production capacity are also fairly easy with larger and smaller print heads (1 nozzle or 100,000) and larger and smaller print areas.

Those are very scalable parameters to design around in flexible designs. This sort of thing is very useful in open designs where the goal is not to come up with a few commercially viable models, but to offer a functional template with as much variety as possible to facilitate innovation among users and collaborators.

The automation required to move print heads and other mechanisms around it isn't too complex. There are many open and commercial components for hardware, and being designed to be operated by a microcontroller how they behave can be defined in software. One of the main values software will add is an ability to adjust and control the machine in different ways, like compensating for different weight and line drag in different printing heads.

There are certain components that will be difficult to replicate like the wide ink-jet style print heads, but those are likely commercially available until we can find a way to produce something more capable. A big part of the initial effort will be researching overall design and available options for specific components, and using an existing commercial or open metal-capable 3D printer until we can eat our own dog food (use our own machine).

In order to keep it totally open it might also be necessary to develop binding solutions (if needed) and anything else that currently exists only as a commercialized and patented product. Those may be secondary priorities, as long as commercial binders are widely enough available. There are safety concerns with chemical binders, increasing their risks and cost of production. Unless there is some really easy binder made from other inexpensive commercially available chemicals, it is unlikely anyone will be mixing their own early on. A better approach long term is to function without a binder.

### Existing Open Software

The software side is also complex, but there is already a great deal of open source software available to help get started. We could use ROS (ros.org) and related open software for the motor/relay/etc controls, there are various open source CAD and slicing applications, and Moqui (moqui.org) to build the production management and monitoring system, with an ERP thrown in for good measure. 

That gives small businesses a more complete solution with functionality to manage raw material and good inventory, production and material planning, equipment and maintenance management, sales, shipping, payment processing, project and task management, customer and other request management, and even a fully featured accounting application. The ERP applications in Moqui are designed for operations with 10-100 users. One person could use it (I do) or 10,000 at once but the primary target market is 10-100 users and that impacts certain UI design decisions.

It runs well on $500 mini servers and even on some newer $100 boards that can be used to make a low-cost cluster with redundancy for high availability (a server goes down, another one picks up the load). When deployed properly, it has security features adequate for financial application and payment processing audits (has been through multiple PCI DSS Level 1 and more stringent audits).

Some of it might be a bit much for individuals running a small fab, but it is open and will be improved over time for this use case. There are also various ecommerce options available, built into the system or integrated external systems. It has integrations for common business to business needs such as receiving customer purchase orders and sending advance ship notices and invoices via EDI, and processing payments via credit card, ACH (NACHA or gateway), and more.

Some work is needed as there hasn't yet been sufficient demand among users, but cryptocurrency payment processing would also be easy to add and would add another layer of independence for users of the machine. For highly secure and independent payment processing a full Bitcoin node could be integrated.

With these and other open source tools we can fairly quickly build a full stack software offering to accompany the hardware designs. This has potential to be a very low barrier to entry solution using a great deal of existing open source software, and maybe even some of the existing open source hardware designs for 3D printers (though current are mostly smaller, slower designs).

### A Business Opportunity

As a business opportunity there is potential for general manufacture of metal parts (and others over time), and also for manufacture of part kits and preassembled 3D printers. These are big enough machines that it may be better to offer partly assembled and packaged for shipping with easy last steps. The initial full offering could effectively be a business in a box, everything except what to build and that is where entrepreneurs can best leverage their efforts.

With a fully open strategy, market share might never be what it could, but market penetration may be far better. At a certain price point and ability level this is like a blue ocean market with significant potential for global adoption. Spearheading a fully open strategy and openly sharing popular resources has significant benefits. One of the most significant is becoming a nexus of distributed innovation.

By moderating contributions to a popular design repository you hear early about everything big, and first about many things. You stay in the loop with the global industry in a way that is impossible behind closed doors. Any open strategy has inherent marketing benefits, and a company that makes machines like this with this sort of story might do well with a marketing budget near zero.

The thing to automate next after automated parts manufacturing would be the next step for the parts: assembly. An assembly bot is a bit different. It doesn't need high precision motion like a part printing bot but it needs a wide range of motion. It may also be that a combination of part bot and assembly bot would be viable, an arm-based robot that can fab multiple parts in place. That would be a challenge, but probably doable... maybe with 3 or more arms that can connect at joints to create movable stable platforms for detailed material or binder deposit.

That's the fantasy, but we can start with much simpler apparati and still reach home-scale economic viability.

### Home-Scale Home Building

Speaking of homes, another bot to consider is a home building bot, or more generally a building building bot. These exist, but they are crude additions to concrete pumping trucks and produce crude results from somewhat expensive material. For a world changing bot, it could use rammed earth or other very cheap materials. With rammed earth a bot could be built on a trailer with outriggers and you could drop it in any decent building site and go on a hike while you watch it build your cabin from your phone. You don’t have to go on a hike, and you don’t have to watch in on your phone. That is just the level of automation it could reach.

In some places other local materials could be used, like wood and stone. Harvesting local resources is more difficult to automate, except dirt which is relatively easy to excavate and sift. It may need a binder to be effective and produce nice looking results, but chances are there is some sort of natural material, polymer, or something that is cheap and would do the trick.

A binder would reduce the on-site energy needed for compressing the dirt, and if the binder is cheap and environmentally friendly enough it might even eliminate the need for compression. The binder doesn't have to be anything fancy. Historically earth binding has been done with straw and dung, and those work well in modern rammed earth homes too.

If abundant energy is available then lightly compressed dirt can be sintered, but with current methods that takes considerable heat and time. A SLS approach might work, but for laser sintering something in bulk a high wattage laser would be required.

Whatever the binding approach, a dirt-based structure fits in well with the current metal powder based state of the art in 3D printing. Heck, if a binder based approach worked for dirt the machine could even build in conduits, vents, or any simple or oddly shaped designs.

Dirt is not a great insulator, but it is good thermal mass. With a printer that can handle multiple materials a think inner wall could be clad by an insulating layer and a weather protective and/or decorative layer. There are nice thermal properties to multiple layers, especially in cold sunny places.

A single layer wall with varying properties by use of different dirt binders for different layers might work out well. It would be fun to try. We just need binders with different combinations of thermal insulation, thermal conduction, weather protection, and decoration.

Decorative color additives to the binder could produce fascinating results with solid colors or even patterns. Most people would likely prefer conservative patterns on their permanent surfaces, but there will certainly be some who choose to get creative and do something regretable akin to getting a tattoo like putting an 8 foot tall image of their face on a wall. There's always wallpaper, or a mural printing bot.

For rammed earth with no ability to fine print, everything would look more like Minecraft. That might not be so bad, it would be very earth-friendly and is an aesthetic that appeals to many people, even if mostly younger people. Why not live in a pixel art home? That's literally what it would be, each voxel being the smallest block size the machine could produce when it compresses the dirt. As a bonus, you can design your house in Minecraft. Being realistic, many people would not want to live in such homes but if they could rent a machine for a day (or even a few days) that builds a play house that their kid designed in Minecraft... maybe. That's not a big market, but there are plenty of other reasons people want to build structures in remote places or for other reasons have more 'flexible' requirements.

The price of such structures made of dirt might also be compelling, even if the electricity to run the machine comes from a more expensive source like an on-site generator like those currently used on some construction sites. For dirt handling it may also be largely hydraulic, more like a tractor than a 3D printer. Concerting a backhoe with a block-maker on the front instead of the wide bucket, and a block mover on the arm instead of a shovel just like other hoe arm tools.  With dirt the material price is effectively zero so there is plenty of room for cost in terms of automation and machine complexity to make it viable vs current methods.

Looking at it economically: if a machine can build a house in a week, humming away on its own and notifying you if anything goes awry, how much would people pay for each hour of use? With some competition in the space, how much might home construction costs decline?

Looking at is as an enabler: if you could buy such a machine instead of buying a house, your house turns into something you can expand, modify, and reduce over time for the carrying cost of owning the machine, and the energy required to operate it (and material like binder, if used). 

The more general possibilities for distributed home-scale automated manufacture are endless, and who knows what sorts of methods and mechanisms people will come up with or how they might change what people do to provide for material needs and wants. 

### Microprocessors

Microprocessors are a critical component of all modern technology. Much of what is involved with additive manufacturing is mechanical and adequate materials and designs for the mechanical parts have been known for at least 80 years. What makes the difference is the ability to control the motors with a general purpose computer capable enough to run software that can handle the complexity of turning 3D models into sequenced motor controls (through various phases and different pieces of software). 

There have been significant advances in precision manufacturing and optimized component designs available today that were not 80 years ago, but without microprocessors it still would not matter for the purposes of automated production. If CPUs and supporting hardware are not available, automated production is similarly not available.

Microprocessors and related communication technology has already democratized access to information, a key part of access to technology. General purpose computing hardware will always be necessary to perpetuate and maintain the information infrastructure we currently have. For a few decades now software has served us mostly by storing, searching, sorting, and securing information.

Newer software with artificial intelligence characteristics can do much more with information, including things previously only in the domain of humans like reading and summarizing information. They may not do those things well, but these are still immature technologies. Even if not with the highest quality results it can still do things no human can in a lifetime, like reading the bulk of the publicly available contents of the internet. No human will ever be able to do that, especially with so many other humans constantly producing more freely available content.

Just as with information and manufacturing, access to the technology of artificial intelligence will increasingly become a vital human resource. Just as with most early technology, AI is the domain of large institutions with large human labor, hardware, energy, and internet connectivity budgets. That will change as more AI oriented hardware is developed and made commercially available. Many graphics cards and CPUs have specialized hardware (ASICs) for the calculations needed for neural networks, but in personal computers and cell phones the abilities are more limited than the $160k server ChatGPT is theorized to run on.

The day will come when a personal AI more capable than ChatGPT will run on an affordable home appliance ($2k within a decade), and eventually on a smartphone. Smartphones already have AI embedded, with Google leading the charge by choosing to add AI processing capacity instead of general purpose processing capacity in their Google Tensor phone chips. It couldn't even come close to running a recent large language model, but it can do local voice and image recognition and processing, local AI voiced call screening, and all sorts of neat tricks with smaller neural networks (but much larger than what could previously be done on a phone).

Access to microprocessors is perhaps the most important element of the entire technology stack of humanity. The value of local production of microprocessors would be enormous. The machines that make these are built for large production volume and cost billions of dollars. It is likely that with current technology it is possible to design something much smaller, slower, and cheaper. The main constraint on this is intellectual property protection. This is an example of a critical component that is currently monopolized.

A fully open end-run around this industry would be an enormous effort with enormous legal risk. Unless laws are changed, the most likely democratized outcome is new microprocessor technology that does not rely on semiconductors and is not subject to the mountain of patents related to them. There is already an open general purpose instruction set called RISC-V that has some commercial use and common software support (via Linux and others). The main part that is missing in terms of open technology is making the physical semiconductors, or some form of physical microprocessor.

Once adequate open microprocessors are available it is only a matter of time before they too are manufactured on a small scale and their production is distributed around the world instead of focused in a few places.

Once humanity reaches that point with far more democratized access to current technology, it is only a matter of time before every sort of science fiction becomes reality. Once any human has access to information and mechanical assistance from machines the nature of our day to day lives will be completely different, and those who want to run will be free to pick up nearly anything they might want to tinker with and push forward for all humanity.
